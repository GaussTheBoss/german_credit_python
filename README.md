# german_credit_python
 
A Logistic Regression Python model to predict loan default.

## Running Locally

To run this model locally, create a new Python 3.6.8 virtual environment
(such as with `pyenv`). Then, use the following command to update `pip`
and `setuptools`:

```
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

And install the required libraries:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Details

Model was trained on the German Credit Data dataset.
`logreg_classifier.pickle` is the trained model artifact.
Sample inputs to the scoring function are included (`df_baseline.json`, `df_sample.json`).

Model code includes a metrics function used to compute Group and Bias metrics.
The metrics function expects a DataFrame with at lease the following three columns three columns: `score` (predicted), `label_value` (actual), and `gender` (protected attribute).
Sample inputs to the metrics function are included (`df_baseline_scored.json`, `df_sample_scored.json`).

The output of the scoring job when the input data is `df_sample.json` is a JSONS file (one-line JSON records). Here are the first three output records:
